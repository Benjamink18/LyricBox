**First 500 characters:**

```
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's ten o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep telling me to live right

To go to bed before the daylight

But then you wake up for the sunrise

You know you don't gotta pretend

Baby, now and then



Don't you just wanna wake up

Dark as a lake

Smelling like a bonfire

Lost in a haze?

If you're drunk on life, babe

I think it's great

But while in this world



I think I'll take my whiskey neat

My coffee b

My coffee black and my bed at three

You're too sweet for me

You're too sweet for me



I take my whiskey neat

My coffee black and my bed at three

You're too sweet for me

You're too sweet for me

## 2. Taylor Swift - Anti-Hero

### Lyrics.ovh

**Status:** ✅ Success

**Length:** 1763 characters

**First 500 characters:**

```
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everyb

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

Tale as old as time

One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming

Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

```
White shirt, now red my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises, on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please

I do what I want when I'm wanting to

My soul? So cynical



So you're a tough guy

Like a really rough guy

Just can't get enough guy

Chest always so puffed guy

I'm that bad type

Make your mama sad type

Make your girlfriend mad type

Might seduce your dad type

I'm the bad guy, duh

You say she's scared of me? I mean

But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

Bad guy, bad guy

```
The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox

And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like



Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy,
