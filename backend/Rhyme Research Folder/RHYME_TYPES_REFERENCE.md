## 1. Rhyme Types by Sound Quality

### Perfect Rhyme (True/Full/Exact Rhyme)
- **Definition**: Words match exactly at the ending — same vowel sound AND same ending consonant
- **Examples**: cat/hat, time/crime, moon/June, cry/lie
- **Effect**: Strongest connection, most satisfying resolution
- **Caution**: Can sound predictable or "nursery rhyme" if overused
- **Use case**: Hooks, chorus payoffs, conclusive moments

### Slant Rhyme (Near/Half/Imperfect Rhyme)
- **Definition**: Similar but not identical sounds
- **Effect**: Less predictable, more sophisticated, conversational
- **Sub-types**:

#### Assonance Rhyme
- **Definition**: Same vowel sounds, different consonants
- **Examples**: fate/save, lake/pain, bad/mad, holes/show/cold
- **Effect**: Creates vowel "chains" that flow naturally

#### Consonance Rhyme
- **Definition**: Same consonant sounds, different vowels
- **Examples**: lamp/limp, milk/walk, this/trusted
- **Effect**: Subtle sonic connection, less obvious

### Family Rhyme
- **Definition**: Words ending with consonants from the same phonetic family (plosives, fricatives, nasals)
- **Examples**: crate/braid (t/d are both plosives), robe/hope (b/p are both plosives)
- **Effect**: Looser connection that avoids cliché while maintaining cohesion

### Additive/Subtractive Rhyme
- **Definition**: Same vowels, plus or minus a consonant sound
- **Examples**: eve/believe, seen/screen, art/heart
- **Effect**: Expands rhyme possibilities while keeping connection

### Identical Rhyme (Identity Rhyme)
- **Definition**: Same word repeated, or homophones (same pronunciation, different meaning)
- **Examples**: 
  - Repetition: "last and they last"
  - Homophones: there/their, know/no, sea/see, pane/pain
- **Effect**: Emphasis, wordplay potential, chant-like quality

### Eye Rhyme (Visual/Sight Rhyme)
- **Definition**: Words spelled similarly that look like they'd rhyme but don't
- **Examples**: love/move, cough/through, wind (air)/wind (turn)
- **Effect**: Works visually in written lyrics, can create surprise when sung

---

## 2. Rhyme Types by Position

### End Rhyme
- **Definition**: Rhyming words at the end of lines
- **Position**: Final word of each line
- **Effect**: Establishes structure, most expected by listeners
- **Most common in**: All genres, especially pop and traditional songwriting

### Internal Rhyme
- **Definition**: Rhyming words within the same line or between middle positions of lines
- **Examples**: "I'm a verbal assassin, smashin' and slashin'"
- **Effect**: Adds rhythm and flow, makes lyrics less predictable
- **Most common in**: Hip-hop, sophisticated pop

### Off-Centered Rhyme
- **Definition**: Rhyme words placed in different spots within bars instead of expected positions
- **Example**: "night" at end of line 1, "highlights" in middle of line 2
- **Effect**: Creates interesting dynamics, avoids predictability

### Neighboring Rhyme
- **Definition**: Rhyme placed 1-2 beats before or after where the other rhyme lands
- **Effect**: Rhythmic interest, syncopation feel

### Cross Rhyme
- **Definition**: Rhymes connecting non-adjacent lines
- **Example**: Line 1 rhymes with line 3, line 2 rhymes with line 4 (ABAB)
- **Effect**: Creates longer arcs of expectation and resolution

---

## 3. Rhyme Types by Syllable Count

### Masculine Rhyme (Single Syllable)
- **Definition**: Rhyme on final stressed syllable only
- **Examples**: time/crime, night/light, cat/hat
- **Effect**: Punchy, direct, strong emphasis

### Feminine Rhyme (Two Syllables)
- **Definition**: Rhyme on final two syllables (stressed + unstressed)
- **Examples**: walking/talking, thunder/wonder, raining/complaining
- **Effect**: Softer landing, more flowing

### Triple Rhyme (Three Syllables)
- **Definition**: Rhyme on final three syllables
- **Examples**: beautiful/dutiful, glittering/twittering, replaceable/traceable
- **Effect**: Bouncy, rhythmic, playful or comedic

### Dactylic Rhyme
- **Definition**: Stressed syllable followed by two unstressed
- **Examples**: merrily/verily, prettily/wittily
- **Effect**: Light, musical quality

## 4. Hip-Hop Specific Techniques

### Multisyllabic Rhyme (Multis)
- **Definition**: Rhymes containing two or more syllables, often across multiple words
- **Examples**:
  - "feels like / steel knife / windpipe" (Eminem)
  - "top of me / monopoly" (Big Daddy Kane)
  - "borderline schizo / sorta fine tits though" (MF DOOM)
  - "tornado / volcano"
- **Effect**: Hallmark of advanced rapping, shows technical mastery
- **Technique**: Break phrases into syllables, match vowel sounds across each position

### Compound Rhyme
- **Definition**: Phrase-to-phrase rhyming where multiple words combine to create the rhyme
- **Examples**:
  - "problems / solve 'em"
  - "hit 'em / hurt 'em / spit 'em / bit 'em / pin 'em / in 'em"
  - "righteous / might just" (Rakim)
  - "honest with ya / father figure"
- **Effect**: Creates longer rhythmic patterns, very satisfying when executed
- **Key insight**: Word boundaries don't matter — sounds do

### Chain Rhyme
- **Definition**: Single rhyme sound extended over multiple consecutive lines
- **Examples**:
  - "tenfold/rental/essential/utensils/confidential/continental"
  - "sidewalk → talk → fault → eyeball → drywall"
- **Effect**: Hypnotic, builds momentum, creates urgency

### Mosaic Rhyme
- **Definition**: Corresponding syllables share similar vowel sounds despite different word structures
- **Examples**: Spreading assonance throughout verses rather than just at line endings
- **Effect**: Creates subliminal cohesion even when rhymes aren't obvious
- **Associated with**: Eminem's technique

### Nested Rhymes (Rhyming Inside of Rhymes)
- **Definition**: Multiple layers of rhyme patterns running simultaneously
- **Example**: "I end careers gears peers ears fears and spears / they say I'm gifted get lifted like the beards and cheers"
  - Main chain: careers/gears/peers/ears/fears/spears/beards/cheers
  - Nested chain: gifted/lifted
- **Effect**: Extremely dense, rewards repeated listening

### Stacked Rhymes
- **Definition**: Multiple half-rhymes combined to create the effect of a full rhyme
- **Example**: "honest with ya" + "father figure" — individually weak, together strong
- **Effect**: Tricks the ear into hearing a complete rhyme

### Monorhyme
- **Definition**: Same rhyme sound repeated for 4+ consecutive lines
- **Examples**: 
  - "'em / 'em / 'em / 'em" (4 lines)
  - AAAA scheme throughout a section
- **Effect**: Obsessive, urgent, hypnotic quality
- **Caution**: Can get predictable — use strategically for tension

### Embedded Rhyme
- **Definition**: Rhyme word hidden inside a longer word
- **Example**: "apologize" contains "lies" — then rhymed with actual word "lies"
- **Effect**: Rewards close listening, clever wordplay

### Homophone Pun
- **Definition**: Using words that sound identical but have different meanings
- **Example**: "windowpane" = "window pain"
- **Effect**: Double meaning, clever payoff, memorable moments

## 5. Common Rhyme Schemes

### Four-Line Schemes

| Scheme | Pattern | Description | Feel |
|--------|---------|-------------|------|
| AABB | Couplets | Lines 1-2 rhyme, 3-4 rhyme | Stable, resolved quickly |
| ABAB | Alternate | 1&3 rhyme, 2&4 rhyme | Balanced, common in pop |
| ABBA | Sandwich/Enclosed | 1&4 rhyme, 2&3 rhyme | Emotionally satisfying, unusual |
| AAAA | Monorhyme | All four lines rhyme | Builds tension, hypnotic |
| XAXA | Half-alternate | Only 2&4 rhyme | Conversational, natural |
| AABB | Couplets | Pairs of rhymes | Direct, statement-like |
| XXXX | No end rhyme | Relies on internal rhyme | Freeform, flow-focused |

### Six-Line Schemes

| Scheme | Pattern | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| AABCCB | Two couplets + connecting B | Structured with payoff |
| XXAXXA | Only lines 3&6 rhyme | Suspended tension |
| AAAXAX | Three rhymes, then break | Surprise at end |
| AABBCC | Three couplets | Extended but stable |

### Hip-Hop Specific Patterns
- **Extra rhymes**: Rhymes that don't structure the verse but add to overall sound
- **Anywhere-in-bar**: Rhymes can land on any beat, not just end of lines
- **Pattern switching**: Changing rhyme scheme mid-verse to show versatility

## 7. Examples from Song Analysis

### Pop Example: "Bad Blood" (Taylor Swift)

**Hook technique — Double Layer:**
```
bad blood / mad love
```
- "bad/mad" = assonance (short A)
- "blood/love" = perfect rhyme (short U sound)
- Two rhyme types stacked = double catchiness

**Compound rhyme in pop:**
```
problems / solve 'em
```
- Compresses "solve them" to match syllable count
- Hip-hop technique borrowed for pop

**Clean couplets (Verse 2):**
```
past / last (perfect)
through / you (perfect)
won't / don't (perfect)
```
- AABB scheme, conclusive feel

---

### Hip-Hop Example: "Love The Way You Lie" (Eminem)

**6-word multisyllabic chain:**
```
feels like → steel knife → windpipe → fight → feels right → flight
```
- All share long "I" sound + consonant endings
- Spans 4 lines
- Internal rhymes (breathe/steel/feels) add secondary layer

**6-part compound chain:**
```
hit 'em → hurt 'em → spit 'em → bit 'em → pin 'em → in 'em
```
- Every phrase: 2 syllables ending in "-it/in + 'em"
- Requires planning entire passage in advance

**Dual simultaneous chains:**
```
Long A: rage → say → ways → today → yesterday → day → playin'
Long O: over → both → know → over → over
```
- Two vowel sounds interweaving
- One catches attention, other creates subliminal cohesion

**Homophone pun payoff:**
```
watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it windowpane
```
- "windowpane" = "window pain"
- Entire verse builds to this wordplay moment

**Embedded rhyme:**
```
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
```
- "apologize" literally contains "lies"
- Deception hidden in the word itself
